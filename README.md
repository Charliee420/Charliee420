# Hi — I'm Hd K 👋

**Hands0me** — yes, you read that right 😏

I’m a B.Tech (Computer Science) Second-year student and a defence aspirant with a passion for Dev, machine learning, and hardware–software fusion research. I build puzzels and things that solve real problems — from realtime multiplayer games to experiments that explore *Silicon meets Neuron* *Quantum* (Research<Ongoing>).
